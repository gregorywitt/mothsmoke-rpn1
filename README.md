A simple rpn pocket calculator with an e-ink display.

Video documentation of the device is at https://youtu.be/oFR_nebGaVM

Let me know if you want any design files exported in a particular format, etc. 

Details that aren't documented well elsewhere:

Display is a GDEY0213B74 2.13 Inch 250x122 Eink Display w/ SSD1680 chipset
Adafruit sells a convienient dev board with the same display (Product ID: 4197)

The battery is the thinnest one I could find on aliexpress:
"EHAO 253450 3.7V 400mAh Ultra Thin Lithium Polymer LiPo Rechargeable Battery Cells For Mp3 GPS Smart Watch Speaker"

The keypad has 1.5mm ball bearings pressed into the little pockets in the back of the keys.

Mothsmoke is my nonexistant consumer electronics company.
